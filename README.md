# Analyzing-Anthems-of-the-World
I started with a question, how many words are in all the anthems of the world. This became interesting and I ended up developing a whole project involving words used in various continents, and even unique words used in each country.
My analysis led me to words in anthems like the mention of GOD in an anthem. The data and code enables one to make amazing plots, that you can reproduce in other types of text data. Please enjoy.
